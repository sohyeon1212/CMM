"""Revert-metabolism: normalization-target prediction via robust MTA (rMTA).

Predicts gene/reaction knockouts that move a perturbed (e.g. disease) metabolic state back
toward a reference (e.g. healthy) state. This is the inverse of the production-design
services: instead of pushing flux toward a product, it ranks interventions by how well they
transform the source flux distribution in the direction implied by two-state expression.

Method (rMTA, Valcarcel 2019, continuous form):
  For each knockout, solve a MOMA-based QP three times with different transformation weights
  - best  (alpha): reward moving target reactions in the desired direction
  - moma  (0):      pure minimal adjustment, neutral
  - worst (-alpha): reward moving target reactions the WRONG way (adversarial)
  Each solution gets a transformation score TS = (correct - wrong movement of target
  reactions) / (1 + steady-reaction disturbance). The robust score rTS combines the three so
  a knockout ranks high only when it transforms well in the best case and is not harmful in
  the worst case.

The continuous rMTA runs on any QP solver. An optional original-MTA MIQP mode is gated on a
MIQP-capable solver.
