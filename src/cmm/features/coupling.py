"""Flux coupling — grouping reactions whose deletion has the same consequence.

A ranking over knockout candidates is only meaningful if each candidate is a distinct
intervention. Three reactions of an unbranched pathway always carry the same flux, so deleting
any one of them stops all three; counting them as three candidates counts one intervention three
times and inflates the denominator of any "top *N*%" claim.

Yizhak et al. (2013) reduce their candidate set this way before ranking — dead-end reactions
out, essential reactions out, then *"the set of simulated knockouts is composed of a member from
each partially coupled set (including singleton sets)"*, which gave them 849 sets for
*E. coli* iAF1260.

**This module computes full coupling, not the paper's partial coupling.** Two reactions are
fully coupled when ``v_i / v_j`` is the same constant in every steady state; partially coupled
when each is non-zero exactly when the other is, with a ratio free to vary. Full coupling is
strictly stronger, so the grouping here is conservative: it can split one of the paper's sets
but can never merge two, and the candidate count it yields is an upper bound on theirs.

The reason for the substitution is cost. Full coupling falls out of one null-space computation;
partial coupling needs flux coupling analysis, which is O(n^2) linear programmes and impractical
at genome scale.

    Every steady state satisfies ``Sv = 0``, so ``v = N c`` for ``N = null_space(S)`` and some

    row with ``c``. If two rows are parallel, the ratio of their fluxes is that constant of
    proportionality in *every* steady state — which is full coupling.

    Rows are normalised and sign-canonicalised before hashing, so ``v_i = -3 v_j`` groups with
    ``v_i = 3 v_j``: the deletion consequence is the same either way.

    ``reactions`` defaults to the whole model. Pass the surviving subset when dead-end and
    essential reactions have already been removed — the grouping is computed over exactly the
    columns given, which is what makes the result a candidate universe rather than a general
