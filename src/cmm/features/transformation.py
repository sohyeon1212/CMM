"""Find knockouts that transform one flux state (condition A) toward another (condition B).

Given a source flux distribution (e.g. condition A, possibly omics-predicted) and a target
distribution (condition B), rank candidate gene/reaction knockouts by how close they bring
the flux to the target. Two methods, **both of them published**:

- ``moma``: for each knockout, the cell minimally adjusts from A (MOMA); rank by how much that
  adjusted state moves toward B (reduction in distance-to-B). This is the MOMA-based
  transforming-perturbation baseline of Yizhak K, Gabay O, Cohen H & Ruppin E (2013),
  "Model-based identification of drug targets that revert disrupted metabolism and its
  application to ageing", *Nat Commun* 4:2632, Methods.
- ``mta``: derive a per-reaction desired direction from B − A and run the MTA MIQP of the same
  paper, via :func:`~cmm.features.revert.revert_targets`.

Neither path is CMM's invention; what is CMM's is deriving the direction set from two explicit
flux states rather than from expression through a GPR, so omics-predicted condition fluxes can
be used directly as source/target.

**The default is ``method="moma"``, and Yizhak et al. report that path as "markedly inferior"
to MTA.** It is kept as the default anyway, for two measured reasons, and labelled here rather
than silently: it needs only QP instead of MIQP and runs about 8× faster per gene at genome
scale (2.4 s against 19.3 s on *i*JO1366, 55 min against 7.3 h for a full gene scan); and on
CMM's own SC-02 condition pair the ``mta`` ranking is the more degenerate of the two — 11
distinct scores against MOMA's 21 before the score fix in :mod:`cmm.features.revert`. The two
rankings share no gene in their top 20 (Spearman ρ = −0.068 over 71 genes), so the choice is
not a mild bias: report both when the answer matters, and read the ``score_resolution`` and
``largest_tie_block`` entries of the result metadata before trusting a top-k.
