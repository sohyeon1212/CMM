description: Run CMM's reproducible production-target workflow for a COBRA model and product exchange, including single-knockout, strain-design, amplification, validation, and publication-report requests. Use for prompts such as "engineer E. coli to produce succinate", "find knockout or over-expression targets", and their Korean equivalents. Do not use for a standalone FBA/FVA question or for omics-only comparison.

# CMM production engineering

Use CMM's public workflow boundary. Do not recreate the pipeline with a bespoke script, add private target-selection rules, or drive the Qt GUI.

## Resolve the run definition

The run needs all three:

1. The exact model path. Preflight loads it and computes the model id/fingerprint; do not ask
   the user to supply a hash.
2. The product **exchange reaction ID**.
3. One explicit condition: medium, substrate exchange and uptake bound, oxygen exchange and aeration bound, plus any other changed bounds.

If these values are already explicit and internally consistent, proceed without asking the user
to reconfirm them. Ask only about missing or ambiguous values that would change the scientific
answer. Stop downstream analysis if the product cannot be resolved to an exchange, the model
does not grow, or theoretical yield is zero; for zero yield, use the clarification protocol to
recommend and ask about a scientifically justified condition change rather than opening bounds
yourself. Treat each condition as a separate run.

Before asking, inspect the model and local environment read-only. Resolve facts that CMM can
determine uniquely, such as the model fingerprint, objective, exchange inventory, current
bounds, and solver or R capabilities. Do not mistake the model's current bounds for the user's
intended biological condition.

If a consequential ambiguity remains, or the user explicitly asks to be interviewed, challenged,
or guided through setup, read
[`references/clarification-interview.md`](references/clarification-interview.md) and use its
adaptive interview. Every decision question must include a clearly labeled recommended option,
the evidence for that recommendation, and how each choice changes the analysis or scientific
claim. Ask one dependent question at a time; group only a few genuinely independent choices.
If an interview was needed, present the resolved run definition and obtain explicit confirmation
before launching the workflow or writing run artifacts. A prompt that was complete from the
start requires neither an interview nor an extra confirmation round.

## Use the canonical entry point

Prefer the checked-in config and thin CLI:

```bash
cmm production-targets --config CONFIG
cmm production-targets --config CONFIG --analysis-only
cmm report render RUN_DIR
cmm report validate RUN_DIR --json
```

The CLI config is UTF-8 JSON loaded by `ProductionWorkflowConfig.from_json`; relative model and output paths resolve from the config file's directory. Without `--analysis-only`, `production-targets` runs analysis, R rendering, and validation. The equivalent Python boundary is `cmm.workflows.production.ProductionWorkflowConfig`, `ProductionWorkflowResult`, and `run_production_target_discovery(config)`. Report rendering and validation are `cmm.reporting.render_production_report(run_dir, renderer="nature-r")` and `validate_production_run(run_dir)`.

Use direct documented CMM analyses only when the user narrows the request to one such analysis.

## Enforce capability gates

- Run the workflow preflight before expensive analyses. Never silently change a method.
- MOMA-L2 needs QP; ROOM and strain design need MILP. OptKnock/RobustKnock also require importable `straindesign`; follow any additional requirement reported by the selected backend. Report an unavailable method as unavailable unless the user explicitly approves a scientifically different substitute.
- Pin `strain_design_seed` explicitly in every publication config (default `0`). The workflow
  passes that same seed to OptKnock and RobustKnock, and both result provenances must record it.
  Do not omit the field and let `straindesign` generate a hidden per-call seed; that can change
  MILP search paths, returned solution pools, and runtime between otherwise identical runs.
- The `nature-r` renderer requires `Rscript` and the packages pinned in `renv.lock`. Treat a missing package or nonzero R exit as a report failure.
- Preserve infeasible/lethal knockouts as results. Rank strain designs by guaranteed product, not maximum product.

## Validate before handoff

Render the report only from workflow CSVs, then run `validate_production_run`. Do not call the run complete while validation contains errors. Inspect the standalone HTML, every figure, the manifest/provenance, and method coverage. Figures must have matching source data and editable vector output in addition to 300-DPI raster output.

Keep FSEOF and FVSEOF as independent method-specific rankings. Export and report the top 10
from each method by default, even when the two sets do not overlap. Shared membership may be
reported as provenance, but it is never a selection gate. Run the loop diagnostic and
target-to-product flux response for every candidate in the two top-10 lists, including loop-flagged
or unresolved candidates. Preserve diagnostic and recommendation-eligibility status separately
from response execution. Retain an unavailable, failed, or otherwise non-runnable candidate as
an explicit skipped/failed/status row instead of silently removing it.

Treat the MOMA and ROOM display-ranked D1–D5 rows as the canonical single-knockout candidate
universe, deduplicated only when genes block the same reaction signature. Retain every
equivalent gene id in the index row's candidate-id provenance and run matched
wild-type/knockout random sampling for every candidate. For flux response, keep the model in
the pre-deletion wild-type background. For exactly one blocked reaction with nonzero reference
flux, scan the closed interval between that reference and zero. If its reference flux is already
zero, scan the reaction's full feasible domain and label the result exploratory; it is not
causal support for deletion. A multi-reaction blocked signature has no unambiguous single scan
axis: retain it as explicit unavailable/skipped with a reason, and never silently choose one
reaction. MOMA/ROOM plus paired sampling establish the complete-knockout effect; a reaction
scan is supporting mechanism evidence only under its stated interpretation.
Beneficial selection and recommendation filters are downstream interpretations; they must
never reduce response or sampling coverage. Preserve any lethal, infeasible,
unavailable, or failed case in the validation indexes with its status and reason.

Plot every completed Figure 5 response with the regulated candidate reaction's enforced flux
on x (`target_flux`) and target-product flux on y (`response_flux`). Amplification is a
wild-type candidate-reaction→product scan. A single-reaction knockout candidate uses the
pre-deletion wild type: reference↔zero when reference flux is nonzero, otherwise the full
feasible reaction domain as an exploratory response. Growth is the configured minimum-growth
constraint and secondary `biomass_flux` output, not a Figure 5 axis.

Treat `max_flux_response_targets` as a capacity guard, never as a runtime top-*N* selector. It
must accommodate the worst-case union before deduplication: twice the configured per-method
amplification count plus twice the configured per-method knockout display count. Reject an
undersized enabled config instead of slicing either candidate universe.

Call an intervention a recommendation only when it appears in the validated `recommendations.csv`; raw MOMA/ROOM, OptKnock, RobustKnock, FSEOF, and FVSEOF rows remain hypotheses. Do not combine a knockout and amplification target unless that combined intervention was separately simulated and validated.

Describe predictions as *in silico* hypotheses requiring experimental validation. Never turn flux amplification into an unvalidated wet-lab fold-change prescription.
